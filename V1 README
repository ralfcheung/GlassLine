V1 README:

Currently, we have delay on the robot to prevent filling the glassline up with too much glass, as we are still having
some problems when we try to increase throughput too much (for some reason popups don't pass glass on to the next conveyor).
Otherwise, everything seems to work. You should observe that conveyors stop before popups that are going up
when there is glass on their last sensors, and conveyors will stop due to the truck leaving. We observed great variability
in the speed of the glassline when we ran it on different people's machines, and this sometimes affected the kinds of 
problems we would observe. On one machine, for example, sometimes when the popup hands off glass to the next conveyor,
it appears to get stuck. All of these issues should be resolved by v2.
