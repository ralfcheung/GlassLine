As far as we know, there is only one case our factory cannot handle: occasionally, a conveyor will send glass to a popup
at the same time that the popup starts moving up because a workstation called it. This causes problems in the popup agent. We
were not able to fix this.  However, this problem happens pretty infrequently (once every couple 100 glasses when running
random glass recipes). Otherwise, our factory handles everything.
